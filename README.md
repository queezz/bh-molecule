This project provides tools to model and fit the **A‚ÄìX band spectra** of boron hydride (BH).
The A‚ÄìX band arises from electronic transitions between the A ¬πŒ† excited state and the X ¬πŒ£‚Å∫ ground state, producing a distinct band system near 432‚Äì434 nm. These spectra are widely used for determining rotational temperature and species concentration in plasmas, as well as for laboratory and astrophysical molecular spectroscopy.

Originally developed as a set of Jupyter notebooks, this codebase is now a Python package with both an API and CLI tools.

**Python example:**

```python
import numpy as np
from bh_molecule.dataio import load_v00_wavelengths
from bh_molecule.physics import BHModel

model = BHModel(load_v00_wavelengths())
x = np.linspace(432.8, 434.2, 4000)
y = model.full_fit_model(x, C=1.0, T_rot=2000, dx=0.0, w_inst=0.02)
```

**CLI example:**

```bash
# Generate a spectrum and save as CSV
bh-spectra-csv --C 5.0 --T_rot 3500 --out spectrum.csv
```
